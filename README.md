# Specification for the lockatme project
The program: https://github.com/Sweenu/lockatme

The specifications are written in french, the rest of the project however
is in english.

### Compilation
To compile the project run the compile.py script. If you need to compile any
specific file, put their names as arguments without extensions.

Exemple: `./compile.py part2 part5`

This will create several compilation files in the root of the directory but
they are ignored in the gitignore anyway.
